# Dataset: 380,000+ lyrics from MetroLyrics
## Motivation
The orignal dataset was created by a kaggle user named GyanendraMishra to explore the correlation between artists of certain genres and commonly abused substances. The one we use is a modified version that contains only english lyrics. It was found on this github repository: https://github.com/hiteshyalamanchili/SongGenreClassification/tree/master/dataset

## Situation
The lyrics themselves were originally written by the various song artists/songwriters for their musical works released over the period of 1968-2016.

## Language variety
English only.

## Collection process
The dataset contains 362,237 songs from 18,231 artists with six columns for each song: song index, title, year released, artist, genre, and lyrics. All songs in the database were released between 1968 and 2016, excluding several songs incorrectly labeled with invalid years. It was created by scraping lyrics from MetroLyrics, which builds its database through user submissions and contributions.

## Annotation process
The only information we have about the annotators is that they are user of MetroLyrics.
